## Scrum Master Role

In the Computer Science portion of the curriculum you have learned a number of skills that help make you a stronger developer. You have more experience solving difficult problems and more general knowledge on how computing systems work from the ground up. You will be responsible primarily for the deployment of the different pieces of the project, The Marketing Site, The Client Side App and the Back End API.

### Your CS Unit has taught you thus far some of the following skills:

- You are a generalist developer
- You have the ability to solve problems that you don't know how to solve, or research solutions to problems you don't know how to tackle.
- You know how to work as a leader and have demonstrated abilities to guide students along the way.

#### Your Primary Role as a Scrum Master

You, yourself, will have pieces of the project to work on. Additionally, your problem solving skills can be brought to bear across many of the project's subsystems, so be available to help anywhere you can. You might have your hands in a lot of different source files. If the project schedule permits it, push your boundaries and set up something more advanced like CI/CD.

IMPORTANT: You're not the manager or boss; you are equal in rank to your teammates. Your job is to serve and enable the other members of the team (and yourself!) to do work more effectively.

## Instructions

Focus on the objectives and desirable outcomes of Build Week listed in the description of this document above. You're aim here is to deliver a product and to work in roles across the development life-cycle of your application.

- **Team communication and collaboration are keys to success here**.
- Lean heavily on your PM and your team for support and exercise the 20 minute rule.
- Develop a git branching strategy and commit work-flow early on and commit your code often.
- You will be graded on this assignment. Pay attention to the Rubrics by which you will be graded in order to effectively utilize the skills you have learned thus far.

### Schedule

The following is a loose schedule for you to abide by while building your projects. Day 0 and Day 5 are the only days that are set in stone. The rest of the week is up to you how you get things accomplished.

#### Day 0 - Kick off
